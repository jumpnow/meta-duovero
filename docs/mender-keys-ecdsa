WARNING: Signature validation using ecdsa keys has been failing for
me ~1% of the time. Using rsa keys I have not seen the same failures.
The failure shows up as the mender-artifact tool generating different
manifest.sig files using the same input. The problem is repeatable
on different machines.

$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private-and-params.key

$ openssl ec -in private-and-params.key -out private.key
read EC key
writing EC key

$ openssl ec -in private-and-params.key -pubout -out public.key
read EC key
writing EC key

The public key gets copied to

  meta-duovero/recipes-mender/mender/files/artifact-verify-key.pem

to be installed on the devices.

The private key is used to sign the artifacts with the mender-artifact tool.

See the script
